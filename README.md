# WGAN-GP on MNIST

This project implements a Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) to generate handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

## Features

- Generator and Critic (Discriminator) networks built with PyTorch.
- Gradient Penalty for improved training stability.
- Image generation using 100-dim latent vectors.
- Training progress visualized at selected epochs.
